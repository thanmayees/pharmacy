# Project: Healthcare Management System

# Overview
I developed a Healthcare Management System using Java and SQL aimed at optimizing the management of patient, drug, and staff data. This system was designed to streamline various administrative and medical processes within a healthcare environment, leading to significant improvements in efficiency and coordination.

# Key Features
Patient Management: Efficiently handled patient records, appointments, and medical histories. The system allowed healthcare providers to quickly access and update patient information, leading to more informed decision-making.

Drug Management: Implemented a drug inventory management module that tracked drug stocks, expiry dates, and automated reorder alerts. This helped in reducing medication errors and ensured that essential drugs were always available.

Staff Management: Managed staff information including schedules, roles, and payroll. The system facilitated better resource allocation and staff coordination.

# Technologies Used
Java: The core backend logic was developed in Java, utilizing object-oriented principles to create a modular and maintainable codebase.
SQL: Used for database management to store and retrieve patient, drug, and staff information efficiently. The system employed optimized queries for fast data processing and retrieval.
Impact
25% Improvement in Efficiency: By integrating these modules, the system significantly improved overall healthcare coordination, leading to a 25% increase in patient care efficiency. This was achieved through the reduction of manual administrative tasks and the provision of real-time data access.
Future Enhancements
Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR): Plan to extend the system to integrate with existing EHR systems for more seamless data exchange.
Mobile Application: Developing a mobile app version for easier access by healthcare professionals on the go.
